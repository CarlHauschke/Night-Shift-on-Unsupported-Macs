# Night-Shift-on-Unsupported-Macs

Night Shift Enable Script for Unsupported Macs
Script made by Isiah Johnson (TMRJIJ) / OS X Hackers

This script will replace the CoreBrightness.framework with one already patched with the matching hex value in CoreBrightness.framework for most older/unsupported hardware.

All credits for this work goes to Piker Alpha. Thanks!
As told, this script is intended as non-commerical, with no Donation requests, Open Source, and must give thanks to PIke!

Night Shift was introduced in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (Build 16E144f and Public Beta-1) and is controlled by the CoreBrightness.framework. The official minimum requirements for this feature are: 

MacBookPro9,x
iMac13,x
Macmini6,x
MacBookAir5,x
MacPro6,x
MacBook8,x

As such, if something goes wrong (like the Display tab in System Preference crashing) or if this framework copy doesn't work. Please feel free to email me at support@osxhackers.net or attempt it manually via Pike's original blog post.
